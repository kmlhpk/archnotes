# **Musings on Arch**
## General Thoughts

I first installed Arch on a Lenovo ThinkPad X280 on the 2020-05-23.

Following the Arch Wiki and asking Alex for help where I couldn't figure something out myself was much better for a complete beginner like myself than my brief attempt at trying to install Manjaro via Architect. The Manjaro wiki is simply not good enough. Sure, Arch installation and basic config took the best part of like, 10 hours. But it was damn fun, and educational too. Though, knowing what I know now, using Architect would probably be a doddle.

After an extended hiatus (mostly due to laziness), I decided to reinstall Arch from scratch on said laptop on 2020-07-26. This was to re-familiarise myself with the process, to document it all properly as I went along, and to prepare myself for installing Arch on the new SSD I bought for my PC. This day was spent mostly trying to figure out how on God's green Earth to configure booting with EFISTUB rather than through a bootloader, during which I learned some cool things about UEFI systems and where to mount the EFI System Partition. I now feel like I could install an Arch system comfortably and quickly, with only this document as my aid - though I still need to document partitioning (as I do it for my new SSD) and figure out how to dual-boot Windows and Arch on my PC.

## Install Process

Following the [Installation Guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide).

`ip link`, `wifi-menu`, `iwctl` to get connected to the internet

`loadkeys uk`

`timedatectl set-ntp true`, `... status`

### Partitions, Filesystems, Mounting

`parted` to start the partitioning process

#### Partitioning a disk

Coming Soon‚Ñ¢

#### Creating filesystems

`lsblk -f` to list filesystems

`findmnt` to find mounted filesystems

`umount -R` to recursively unmount a target and all its kids

`mkfs.fat -F32 [target]` for UEFI part, `mkfs.ext4 [target]` for other parts

#### Mounting filesystems

##### Laptop

Mount root (`/`) partition `nvme0n1p2` to `/mnt` using `mount /dev/nvme0n1p2 /mnt`

Create `/mnt/boot` and `/mnt/home` directories (`mkdir`), and mount the EFI and home partitions to them, respectively

##### PC

Coming Soon‚Ñ¢

### Installing the system

`pacman -Sy reflector` in the USB system, and then run `reflector --latest 15 --protocol https --sort rate --save /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist` to... do the thing

Install Arch and some basic text and networking utilities with `pacstrap /mnt base linux linux-firmware nano netctl networkmanager` 

Run `genfstab -U /mnt >> /mnt/etc/fstab`, check the resulting file

### Enter the new system

`arch-chroot /mnt`

Run `ln -sf /usr/share/zoneinfo/Europe/London /etc/localtime`, `timedatectl set-timezone Europe/London` and `hwclock --systohc`

Uncomment relevant locales in `/etc/locale.gen` and run `locale-gen`

`echo "LANG=un_GB.UTF8" >> /etc/locale.conf`

`echo "KEYMAP=uk" >> /etc/vconsole.conf`

`echo "[hostname]" >> /etc/hostnames`

Edit the `/etc/hosts` file to say:

```
127.0.0.1	localhost
::1		localhost
127.0.1.1	myhostname.localdomain	myhostname
```
Set root password with `passwd`

Install `efibootmgr`

Run `efibootmgr --disk /dev/[disk name] --part [boot partition number] --create --label "Arch Linux" --loader /vmlinuz-linux --unicode 'root=UUID=[boot partition UUID] silent initrd=\initramfs-linux.img' --verbose`

OPTIONAL: Install refind, and then edit `/boot/refind_linux.conf` to say something like `"boot with standard options" "root=UUID=XXX...."`

`exit`, `umount-R /mnt`, `reboot` into the new system!

### Create non-root user 
```
useradd -m -G wheel [username] 
passwd [username]
visudo /etc/sudoers to reflect changes
```

### Get rid of weird caching message

## //TODO

### ‚ùå make `NetworkManager` start up automagically

### ‚ùå kernel parameters? microcode???

### ‚úÖ get AUR helper `yay`

### üîÅ ensure arch boots properly and fast

using `systemd-analyze`, I found refind took at least 8 seconds to boot. Direct EFISTUB booting takes about 20ms. Not sure if I can make refind any faster, or if I can decrease the firmware, kernel or userspace t

### ‚ùå make a script to make changing EFISTUB boot using `efibootmgr` less painful

### ‚ùå make refind boot menu pretty (PC)

### ‚úÖ `alsa`, `alsa-utils`, `alsa-packages` for sound management

### üîÅ check if it's my laptop speakers that sound shit or if I can configure sound to be better

(2020-05-25) Using my headphones I have ascertained that the speakers were shit and the audio output was fine. Still want to do some tweaking and EQ to make it as good as possible

### ‚ùå disable Fn mute LEDs forever, if possible

### ‚ùå make swapfile

### ‚ùå make sure laptop goes to sleep properly

### ‚ùå ensure performance and battery conservation are balanced

## Confugring a terminal emulator

`st` appears to be the best of them, but it looks very difficult to customise. I can't seem to decide on a second-best option.

## Configuring a wm

Tempted to try `dwm` or `xmonad`, might stick with `i3wm` for the time being though.

## Configuring the Status Bar

### ‚ùå make it look nice

### ‚ùå volume controls

### ‚ùå music indicator + controls

### ‚ùå bluetooth controls

### ‚ùå battery indicator
