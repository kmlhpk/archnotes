# kmlhpk's ***Musings on Arch***
## General Thoughts

I first installed Arch on a Lenovo ThinkPad X280 on the 23rd of May 2020.

Following the Arch Wiki and asking Alex for help where I couldn't figure something out myself was much better for a complete beginner like myself than my brief attempt at trying to install Manjaro via Architect. The Manjaro wiki is simply not good enough. Sure, Arch installation and basic config took the best part of like, 10 hours. But it was damn fun, and educational too. Though, knowing what I know now, using Architect would probably be a doddle.
